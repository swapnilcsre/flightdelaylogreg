# flightdelaylogreg
To interpret the problem as a Machine Learning problem and define the goal to predict accurately whether a new flight, not in this dataset, will be delayed or not. The outcome variable is a variable called Flight Status, coded as delayed or on time. The objective of this assignment is to understand that an ML model with high accuracy is often not the only objective, and qualitative analysis is required and reported for ease of understanding
